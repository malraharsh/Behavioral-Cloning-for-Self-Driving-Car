So, this project started by collecting the images from three angles by running a car on Udacity Simulator, while also recording the steering angles values. Then we started importing the necessary libraries like the keras TensorFlow, OpenCV. Then we collected the data by running our car and recording the images. These images were then read from the folder and firstly we started processing the images to make it uniform input for our model. We applied data augmentation techniques so that our model is able to generalize well and to reduce the overfitting. The augmentation techniques applied were randomly flipping, cropping, changing the brightness and various others. We further continued by preprocessing the data by normalizing the pixel values to come in range 0 to 1 and then mean centered. 
Then we loaded these images in batch to save memory and faster processing.
Then we defined our NVIDIA model architecture which will be used to make prediction of steering angles and thus drive the car in simulator. We defined the input planes, the convolutional layers, pooling layers and the fully connected layers. 
We finally validated our model by validation data and checked it for real world by test data and at the same time applied techniques to further improved the model by increasing the epochs to give it more time for training and also increasing the depth to better capture more features. Then at lasts we plotted the plot for the loss of training and validation loss.
